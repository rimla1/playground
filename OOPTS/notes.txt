Inheritance - Linking subclasses with superclass
We have no more methods in subclasses, so we only have to maintain superclass...
If subclass inheritance something that it shouldn't, we can just overriding it.

Superclass KNOWS its INSTANCE VARIABLES.
Superclass DOES some METHODS

What's the difference between a class and an object?
*A class is not an object. But it's used to construct an object.*
*A class is a blueprint for an object. it tells Typescript how to make an object of each particular type.*
